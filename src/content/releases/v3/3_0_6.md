# v3 Update - NEW API 

So this was needed from the beginning due to the way the `@tryghost/content-api` works, we have now switched to the `@ts-ghost/core-api` with our own Content-API running on top.  I am thrilled to announce that it is now up and running and working! and our demo is already updated.

### New Stuff

- Converted Github Repo into a Monorepo to hold all of Astro-ghostxyz related content.
- Migrated from `@tryghost/content-api` to `@ts-ghost/core-api`.
- Updated the Theme to use the new API
- Moved theme into its own NPM package to prepare for the future plans of more themes!
- Resolved all github workflow issues so i can now do everything i was doing before

### Planned Additions

- Skeleton Theme - DIY KIT
