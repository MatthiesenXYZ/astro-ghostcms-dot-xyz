## We now have a DIY Starter Kit!

As of the posting of this message, we now have a Template Repo, for those who wish to create a custom frontend and not use one of our themes.  This repo allows you to take a exisiting working project and modify it freely.

To get started checkout the [Repo on Github](https://github.com/MatthiesenXYZ/astro-ghostcms-basicstarterkit)
